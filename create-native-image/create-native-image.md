# Develop Helidon Application

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to create a Helidon MP application.

Estimated Time: 15 minutes

### About Product/Technology

Helidon is designed to be simple to use, with tooling and examples to get you going quickly. Since Helidon is just a collection of libraries running on a fast Netty core, there is no extra overhead or bloat. Helidon supports MicroProfile and provides familiar APIs like JAX-RS, CDI and JSON-P/B. Our MicroProfile implementation runs on our fast Helidon Reactive WebServer. The Reactive WebServer provides a modern, functional, programming model and runs on top of Netty. Lightweight, flexible and reactive, the Helidon WebServer provides a simple to use and fast foundation for your microservices.

With support for health checks, metrics, tracing and fault tolerance, Helidon has what you need to write cloud-ready applications that integrate with Prometheus, Jaeger/Zipkin and Kubernetes.

### About Helidon CLI

The Helidon CLI lets you easily create a Helidon project by picking from a set of archetypes. It also supports a developer loop that performs continuous compilation and application restart, so you can easily iterate over source code changes.

The CLI is distributed as a standalone executable (compiled using GraalVM) for ease of installation. It is currently available as a download for Linux, Mac and Windows. Simply download the binary, install it at a location accessible from your PATH and youâ€™re ready to go.

### Objectives
* Install the Helidon CLI
* Create a MicroProfile supported microservice called Helidon Greeting
* Run and exercise the Helidon Greeting app
* View health and metrics data
* Add new functionality to the app
