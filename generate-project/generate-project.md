# Set up an Oracle Kubernetes Engine instance on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure

## Introduction

In this lab, you will create a 3-node Kubernetes cluster configured with all of the necessary network resources. The nodes will be deployed in different availability domains to ensure high availability.

For more information about OKE and custom cluster deployment, see the [Oracle Container Engine](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/ContEng/Concepts/contengoverview.htm) documentation.

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

### About Product/Technology

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Container Engine for Kubernetes is a fully-managed, scalable, and highly available service that you can use to deploy your container applications to the cloud. Use the Container Engine for Kubernetes (sometimes abbreviated OKE) when your development team wants to reliably build, deploy, and manage cloud-native applications. You specify the compute resources that your applications require, and OKE provisions them on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure in an existing OCI tenancy.

### Objectives

You will use the *Quick Create* cluster feature to create an OKE (Oracle Kubernetes Engine) instance with the required network resources, a node pool, and three worker nodes. The *Quick Create* approach is the fastest way to create a new cluster. If you accept all the default values, you can create a new cluster in just a few clicks.


### Prerequisites

You must have an [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure](https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/cloud-infrastructure) enabled account.
